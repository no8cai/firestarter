        To stamp the drawings I have used specific printmaking inks, plates, tools and techniques such: Aquatint, etching, drypoint, mezzotint, burin and lithography  As well, I've used high density papers to stamp the motives, from 200 gr - 350 gr. (Michelle, Fabriano, Gvarro, etc.).""",

A space to lend my voice and over a decade of experience as a practitioner in the field of the healing arts.  Our bodies are yearning for an awakening to creativity, play, and healing.  It's time we listened. ALCHEMY is a four part docuseries walking you through ancient and modern healing practices used around the world.  We're finding the most powerful modalities in the sacred spaces of Bali, Peru, India and the US and educating you about them.  The practitioners in the field will be sharing their stories - their awakening and calls to heal.  We're listening.
# We're heading to Bali for Part One, where I've chosen to illuminate breathwork, sound healing, and holistic spa treatments.  We will take you into the beauty of Bali to show you why it is considered a sacred space and how these sacred sciences are changing lives. My Mission: To research, experience and document modern and ancient healing arts used in sacred spaces across the world.

Papa Gil is the last of the brothers still working with full power carrying the tradition of his lineage with the highest skill and integrity. The medicine that has run through all of them is priceless.

        As someone who has been heavily involved in the music scene throughout the West Coast, I'll tell you that I have never experienced anything like the aftermath of a pandemic that kept us apart for 2+ years. (Pollstar estimated the total lost revenue for the live music industry in 2020 at more than $30 billion). While Boise's live music scene came to a screeching halt, we also experienced dramatic and sudden population growth and rent increases that many of us couldn't afford. Not to mention, lack of mental health access, took on second jobs, and are still dealing with plenty of stressors that pushed many artists and musicians out of Idaho.""",

One, although we anticipate completing our Kickstarter rapidly after we get funding (due to the ease of getting the materials we need) we gave ourselves an extra 2 months to complete fulfilment based on our last campaign having been delayed by a month.
        Here's our challenge: We dropped the ball with communication last time: we simply were not ready for the volume of interest (we though we might get 100 orders if we were very lucky, we got 1500...) . We were open and honest, and people appreciated that, but we also went deep into just getting things going and didn't take a second to stop and tell people what was happening. We will be doing better on this this time around.
        There are minimal risks here, we could fund this project ourselves in a years time. We will fulfil every order and no one will be left behind. The risks are all customer service issues like us missing an email or us not updating the Kickstarter as much as we should.
